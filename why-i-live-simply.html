  <p>A commodity has no brand. If I’m buying wheat by the ton or coffee by the pound or bandwidth by the GB, I don’t have any expectations other than spec. Get me exactly what I got yesterday, faster and cheaper, and I’ll pay you for it.</p>

  <cite>(Seth Godin, <em>This Is Marketing.</em> )</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>We treat life as a commodity. We have no expectations for our lives. Most of us want more from life, not caring about its quality. So we do more, eat more, work more, and have more, faster and cheaper, believing that we live more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great hoax which we are perpetuating every day of our lives is that that we are making life easier, more comfortable, more enjoyable, more profitable. We are doing just the contrary. We are making life stale, flat and unprofitable every day in every way. One ugly word covers it all: waste. Our thoughts, our energies, our very lives are being used up to create what is unwise, unnecessary, unhealthy.</p>

  <cite>(Henry Miller, <em>Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch.</em> )</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us want more from life, whereas few of us want more of life. The difference lies in what we ask of our lives. We ask for life-complicating crud. More food that kills us. More work but less life. More money but no joy.</p>

<p>More does not lead to a better life. Less does. We know this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail.</p>

  <cite>(Henry David Thoreau, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Walden</em></a>.)</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>I live a simple life because I want an enjoyable, better life. I don’t want to live like an ant, devouring everything that I touch. I want to savor my life; see what good is in it and learn from it. I value my life as something with great expectations.</p>
