 <ol>
  <li>Life is suffering.</li>
  <li>To be is to have limitations, and to have limitations is to suffer.</li>
  <li>The purpose (function) of life is to be alive; to simply be.</li>
  <li>It’s not enough for us to be alive; we believe there has to be more to Life.</li>
  <li>We must justify our suffering to feel alive.</li>
  <li>Meaning (value) justifies our being; meaning makes us feel alive.</li>
  <li>But, Life is meaningless like that of blank canvas or a sheet of paper; it has the potential to be valuable.</li>
  <li>Objects in the world have the potential to make good impressions on our lives.</li>
  <li>We create meaning when we discover the things that make good impressions on our lives.</li>
  <li>We hold our meaning in the things that make good impressions on our lives; we call these things “meaningful” to us.</li>
  <li>To find meaningful things, we must have a healthy moral intuition; we must know and preserve the difference between good and evil.</li>
  <li>To have moral intuition, we must be virtuous.</li>
  <li>To be virtuous, we must live with the four cardinal virtues: justice, wisdom, courage, and temperance.</li>
  <li>Live with the virtues by sheathing our minds, limiting our racing thoughts.</li>
  <li>Learn to quiet your mind by mastering your being.</li>
  <li>Master your being through self-actualization.</li>
