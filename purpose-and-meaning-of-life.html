      <h1>Purpose and Meaning of Life</h1>
        <h2>That we give life meaning through our impressions of it</h2>

 <p>A few weeks ago, a friend confided in me that they were feeling lost. They had a rough day, the cherry to a shit sundae, and were feeling down about it. They said they trying to find themselves. They were looking for their purpose in life.</p>

<p>I replied as best as I could, trying to help. I cited quotes. I tried to teach them the philosophical understanding of self, purpose, and meaning that I had. I thought that’d help. To be honest, I’m not sure I helped them at all. In the weeks since, though, I’ve discovered new ways of thinking about purpose and meaning of life. Now, I can part some wisdom.</p>

<p>First, definitions. We’re used to using purpose and meaning for intention, aim, or for some other mystical, spiritual idea. This misuse of these words complicates what I now believe to be simple problems. The misuse adds to the confusion, giving way to the notions of “finding purpose” and “finding meaning.” So, let us think “function” when we say or mean “purpose” and think “value” when we say or mean “meaning.” Purpose is “function,” and meaning is “value.” More, think of “function” as in “what a thing does.” A cup’s function is to hold something, like a liquid. And think of “value” as in “the value we hold for something.” The value of the cup is determined by the value we hold for the cup, or put another way, by how much we like the cup.</p>

<p>The problem of purpose is that we believe that we are supposed to do something greater than ourselves. This is an observation Alan Watts had about people. Some think their purpose in life is to cure cancer or create something original. Some think their purpose is to make a billion dollars or to lead troops into battle. “The truth,” Bruce Lee writes in one of his essays, “is that Life is an ever-going process, ever-renewing, and it is just meant to ‘lived’, but not ‘lived for’. It is something that cannot be squeezed into a self-constructed security pattern, a game of rigid control and clever manipulation.” The purpose most people think they know is just that: rigid control, clever manipulation of their lives. They seek a purpose outside of themselves because they believe it is safer. We see a famous or successful person and believe that their fame and success are what we should do in our own lives. But “the [function] of life is just to be alive,” said Alan Watts. “It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.” It’s not. “The duty of a human being,” writes Lee, “is to become transparently real, to simply be.” No more is asked of us.</p>

<p>The reason no more is asked of us is because “to be alive” is the natural function of life itself. From the tiniest microbes to the largest whales &mdash; their purpose, all life’s purpose is just to be alive, to exist, to be, to live, to survive in whatever way is natural. My cat is not concerned with the ways of the world, but with sleeping, and perhaps later on, on finding a mouse to munch on or bothering the birds as play. Not much more is in the cat’s purpose in life.</p>

<p>Living is the purpose of life, its function, so why do we believe that our purpose is any different? Why do we want to do more than what is merely asked of our existence? Why are we not satisfied and content with merely living our lives? Because it was not enough for us to simply live our lives. We wanted more, and we believed down to our deepest, most intimate cores, that there had to be more to life, but the truth was that the more we craved didn’t exist. So, we created it. We made it true that there is more to life through our big brains and our fancy thinking. So, what is that more? Meaning.</p>

<p>The problem with meaning is that we believe it exists out there in the world, and we’re supposed to find it. Not so. The reality is that we created meaning &mdash; it comes from within us. We create meaning. We forge value for our lives. How so? Through what I call “good impressions,” an impression being “the way something makes us think or feel.” So, the attraction we feel for a beautiful person is a good impression because it makes us feel good. Attraction is a good feeling, as is the softness of a kitten’s fur, which is another good impression. The cuteness of a baby is a good impression. The opposite is true too: a mean-spirited person leaves a bad impression on us, as does a song that doesn’t meet up with our tastes in music. (Then we say that the person and song are “bad” whereas the kitten and baby are “good.”)</p>

<p>These impressions we see are natural. So natural that our brains identify them in milliseconds to seconds. How do our brains determine a good impression from a bad one? Through our moral intuition. We are born knowing that there is a difference between good and evil, and our brains use this difference to determine what is good and bad to us. This is why it is important to promote a healthy moral intuition by being virtuous. Because if it becomes diseased, we cannot differentiate what’s good between what’s bad. As such, we cannot create meaning for our lives. This causes us undue suffering.</p>

<p>Anything and anyone can make an impression on us. We focus on good impressions the most, for when something makes a good impression on us, we create meaning based on it. In turn, that thing holds meaning, value for our lives. In a word, when we discover that something gives us a good impression, we create and attach value to that thing, and are subsequently creating value for our lives. Consider it this way: one day I discovered a song by Max Richter called “Mrs. Dalloway: In The Garden,” and it made a good impression on me. I loved the song for some reason that I could not explain. (You will find that, of these things you like or love, it is hard to explain why. In truth, you shouldn’t try to find that why as in doing so you’ll only destroy the love you feel for the thing. Suffice it to say that you love the thing for its sake.) I say, now, that the song gives meaning to my life. What I mean is that the song sparked me to create value for my life as a result of its good impression on me, and I placed that value in that song. The song holds my value, my meaning, and every time I listen to it, I borrow and renew that value it holds for my life.</p>

<p>Bringing it together, here’s an analogy: Life as a blank canvas that has no value. It has no meaning because it’s blank; what is impressed upon the canvas gives it meaning, value. Then I say that the canvas of life has the potential to be valuable if the right objects are discovered in the world. Those right objects are anything or anyone that will make a good impression on the canvas. Now the canvas has value if those objects do make a good impression on the canvas. What determines what objects make good impressions on the canvas? Well, the canvas itself; suffice to say it knows what works for it somehow.</p>

<p>Here’s another analogy: NASCAR drivers wear racing suits that bear the names and logos of their sponsors who pay them to race. Imagine that you wear a similar suit, upon which bears the names and images of things that you found to sponsor your life. In a word, those things on your suit give meaning, value to your living. They justify your existence, your suffering.</p>

<p>Going back to purpose, it wasn’t enough that we existed because existing is suffering. Life is suffering, as the Buddhists teach. Being has its limitations. We needed something to justify those limitations, and by extension, our suffering. Meaning, the value of our lives, does that. Meaning justifies our suffering.</p>

<p>When you feel as though your life is meaningless, remember that you alone create meaning. You won’t find it outside of yourself.  We wrongly associate the discovery of meaningful things with the meaning itself.  We do not remember or know that we created the meaning and attached it to the discovered thing. The value of life originated with you, and always will. And the purpose of your life will always be to just live.</p>

<p>So, when you feel down: bring your attention to all the things that hold meaning for your life. Keep a list, add to it often. Review the things on the list. Listen to the music, hang out with your friends, love your partner, and do the things that bring you the most joy in life. That joy is the value of your life; the justification of being alive.</p>

<p>Though, a word of caution: remember to not become attached to what holds value for your life. It is a fine balance between the problems of hedonism and the problems of asceticism. When we cling too much to the things that hold our value, that is the pursuit of pleasure, and it leads only to the pursuit of pain. What else is left when we have squeezed our value out of all the things in life than our pain and the suffering of others? And when we hold to nothing that holds our value, what is left but the suffering of our existence? So, learn the balance. Appreciate what holds value to you and be prepared to let it go when it becomes necessary. Do not cling, do not hang-up on it. That is desirelessness: not the absence of desire but the mastery of it; or, the letting it be as it sees itself fit to be. The more we let go, the more that comes back, and the more value we have for our lives.</p>

<p class="quote-align">“But what am I to do with my life?” you ask. You let it be, as that is its purpose, and in doing so, you allow it to do what it naturally wants to do. Such a question is based on the fear that you will mislive your life if you do not discover and do the thing that Providence or Fate asks of your life. And while I do believe that we all have certain things we’re supposed to do within our lives, these things are not the purpose of our lives. But by letting your life be will you allow it to do what Providence or Fate wants you to do. We have Mozart’s music because he let his life be, and it became a composer. And we have Shakespeare’s plays because he let himself live, and he lived to be the greatest writer ever. All real people became who they are because they let themselves become who they were meant to be. Do the same. Let Providence or Fate sort the rest of it.</p>

<p class="quote-align">“But how am I do live?” you ask. Bruce Lee was concerned with the same question. He wrote in one of his essays that there existed two ways of living: that of self-image actualization, which is what most people do today. This is the needing to live outside themselves. They need to do something beyond themselves. That thing beyond themselves is their image; in a word, their ego. Lee believed this way of life wastes the vital energies of life itself. One never becomes who they were meant to be by living this way. The better way to live, Lee believed, was by self-actualization. Lee writes, “In life, what can you ask for but to be real; to fulfill your potential instead of wasting energy on actualizing your dissipating image, which is not real and means of expending your vital energy. We have great work ahead of us, and it requires devotion and much, much energy. To grow, to discover, we need involvement, which is something I experience every day, sometimes good, sometimes frustrating. No matter what, you must let your Inner Light guide you out of the darkness.” You allow your Inner Light to do its job by letting your life alone. Simple be; live.</p>

<p>So, grow, discover, play, learn &mdash; live your life such that you may fulfill your potential and do your destined work. Lee would say to culture self-help: “daily discoveries through choiceless observation, honestly, as well as wholeheartedly always doing one’s best; a sort of indomitable, obsessive dedication; and, above all, realizing that there is no end or limit to this, because life is simply an ever-going process, an ever-renewing process.” Have no fear of being yourself. Learn to be better, to do better, and to think better. And stop trying to find your Self, that elusive ideal. It cannot be found! as it is not a thing that exists with some definable image or identity but is an infinitely complex, ever-changing composition of everything that exists in your life. See to the stars, and find your Self there; see to the people, and find your Self there; see to your good work, and find yourself there; see to all the things that hold meaning for your life, and see your Self there; see to the grandest and deepest of schemes, and see your Self there; and still, find that your Self is not there in whole.</p>

<p>Let go of all that. Be. Live. Remember your purpose. Remember where meaning comes from. Let go of everything that doesn’t fit these definitions, and finally, live your life as you are meant to live it.</p>
